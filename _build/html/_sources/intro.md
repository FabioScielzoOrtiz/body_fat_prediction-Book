# Body Fat Prediction

‚û°Ô∏è The body fat percentage of an individual can be estimated once the body density has been determined (Siri, 1956), assuming that the body is made up of two components: lean body tissue, fat tissue.

- According to Siri, body fat percentage depends on body density, which is calculated, using the underwater weighing technique, as the difference between the body weight measured in air and the weight measured during immersion in water (Katch and McArdle (1977)).

üîªThe aim is to estimate body fat percentage according to the Siri equation without using body density as a variable, as in practice it is costly to calculate.

Machine Learning methodologies are used to find the best model to estimate (predict) the body fat percentage of individuals without the need to calculate body density.
